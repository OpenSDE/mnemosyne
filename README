Mnemosyne Linux v0.4.x

Mnemosyne is a abstract distribution originally designed for
ROCKLinux [1], but currently only support the trunk of OpenSDE [2].

Mnemosyne is a fully modular abstract target which founds itself over
highly secure and reliable packages instead of deprecated 'de facto'
standard packages like sysvinit, netkit and vixie-cron.

Mnemosyne, use `runit`[3] init style, and since 0.4 the rest of the
tools implemented by `sysvinit` are replaced with `busybox`[4]
equivalents. We use udhcpc from busybox too, and only support
`iproute2`[5] instead of the deprecated classic ifconfig/route/arp.

Mnemosyne is licensed under GPLv2+, but this doesn't affect distributions
implemented extending (without altering) mnemosyne itself.
