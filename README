Mnemosyne Linux v0.3.x

powered by OpenSDE!

Mnemosyne is a abstract distribution originally designed for
ROCKLinux [1], but currently only support the trunk of OpenSDE [3].

Mnemosyne is a fully modular abstract target which founds itself over
highly secure and reliable packages instead of deprecated 'de facto'
standard packages like sysvinit, netkit and vixie-cron.

Backward compatibility with T2 [2] is been kept at the t2-friendly
branch, at svn://svn.opensde.net/mnemosyne/branches/t2-friendly

Future development will most probably not merged back into that branch.
