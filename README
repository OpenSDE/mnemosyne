Mnemosyne is a abstract distribution originally designed for
ROCKLinux [1], but currently only support the trunk of OpenSDE [2].

Mnemosyne is a fully modular abstract target which founds itself over
highly secure and reliable packages instead of deprecated 'de facto'
standard packages like sysvinit, netkit and vixie-cron.
